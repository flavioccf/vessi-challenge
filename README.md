# Vessi - Front End Developer Assignment

## Part 2 - Product Grid Development

This assignment was made using **React.js** and **TypeScript**
The project is available at https://vessi-challenge.vercel.app

No **UI Framework** was used and all CSS was created from scratch in order to display a broader variety of skills with **JavaScript** and **CSS**

### The main libraries used were

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) to create CSS in JS
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to lint and keep code clean across all files
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) to create End To End tests

### The results achieved were

- Create a Product Grid
- Change product image on hover Product Card
- Display size selection when clicking *Quick Add* on desktop
- Display overlay card with size selection when clicking *Quick Add* on mobile device
- Filter by colour (the other filters are non functional)
- Created E2E tests using Cypress

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
