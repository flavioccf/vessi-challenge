## Part 2 - Product Grid Development

This assignment was made using **React.js** and **TypeScript**
The project is available at https://vessi-challenge.vercel.app

No **UI Framework** was used and all CSS was created from scratch in order to display a broader variety of skills with **JavaScript** and **CSS**

### The main libraries used were

- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com) to create CSS in JS
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org) to lint and keep code clean across all files

### The results achieved were

- Create a Product Grid
- Change product image on hover Product Card
- Display size selection when clicking *Quick Add* on desktop
- Display overlay card with size selection when clicking *Quick Add* on mobile device
- Filter by colour (the other filters are non functional)
